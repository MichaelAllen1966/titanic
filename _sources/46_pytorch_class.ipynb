    "# PyTorch class-based neural net\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook we build a neural network to predict survival. The two common frameworks used for neural networks (as of 2020) are TensorFlow and PyTorch. Both are excellent frameworks. TensorFlow frequently requires fewer lines of code, but PyTorch is more natively Python in its syntax, and also allows for easier debugging as the model may be interrupted, with a breakpoint, and debugged as necessary. This makes PyTorch particularly suitable for research and experimentation. A disadvantage of using PyTorch is that, compared with TensorFlow, there are fewer training materials and examples available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both TensorFlow and PyTorch allow the neural network to be trained on a GPU, which is beneficial for large neural networks (especially those processing image, sound or free-text data). In order to lever the benefits of GPU (which perform many calculations simultaneously), data is grouped into batches. These batches are presented to the CPU in a single object called a Tensor (a multi-dimensional array). \n",
    "\n",
    "Installation instructions for PyTorch may be found at pytorch.org. (If in doubt about what installation to use, use `pip install` and use CPU-only, not CUDA). If you are using Anaconda then it is advised to create a new environment, and install pytorch, numpy, pandas, sci-kit learn and matplotlib into that new environment. For more on Anaconda environments see: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-environments/\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two versions of this workbook. This version uses a class-based method which offers some more flexibility (but at the cost of a little simplicity). The alternative version uses simpler form but at the cost of some flexibility. It is recommended to work through both methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not the intention here to describe neural networks in any detail, but rather give some introductory code to using a neural network for a classification problem. For an introduction to neural networks see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for PyTorch here keeps all calculations on the CPU rather than passing to a GPU (if you have one). Running neural networks on CPUs is fine for small amounts of structured data such as our Titanic data. GPUs come in to their own for large sets of data or unstructured data like images, sound clips, or free text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process of a neural network consists of three general phases which are repeated across all the data. All of the data is passed through the network multiple times (the number of iterations, which may be as few as 3-5 or may be 100+). The three phases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pass training X data to the network and predict y\n",
    "* Calculate the 'loss' (error) between the predicted and observed (actual) values of y\n",
    "* Adjust the network a little (as defined by the learning rate) so that the error is reduced. The correction of the network is performed by PyTorch or TensorFlow using a technique called 'back-propagation'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning is repeated until maximum accuracy is achieved (but keep an eye on accuracy of test data as well as training data as the network may develop significant over-fitting to training data unless steps are taken to offset the potential for over-fitting, such as use of 'drop-out' layers described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Neural Networks are most often used for complex unstructured data. For structured data, other techniques, such as Random Forest,s may frequently be preferred."

    "\n",
    "Here we use the class-based method to set up a PyTorch neural network. The network is the same as the sequential network we previously used, but is built using \n",
    "\n",
    "We will put construction of the neural net into a separate function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural net is a relatively simple network. The inputs are connected to two hidden layers (of 240 and 50 nodes) before being connected to two output nodes corresponding to each class (died and survived). It also contains some useful additions (batch normalisation and dropout) as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The layers of the network are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) An input layer (which *does* need to be explicitly defined when using the class method). \n",
    "\n",
    "2) A linear fully-connected (dense) layer.This is defined by the number of inputs (the number of input features) and the number of nodes/outputs. Each node will receive the values of all the inputs (which will either be the feature data for the input layer, or the outputs from the previous layer - so that if the previous layer had 10 nodes, then each node of the current layer would have 10 inputs, one from each node of the previous layer). It is a linear layer because the output of the node at this point is a linear function of the dot product of the weights and input values. We will expand out feature data set up to 240 outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) A batch normalisation layer. This is not usually used for small models, but can increase the speed of training and stability for larger models. It is added here as an example of how to include it (in large models all dense layers would be followed by a batch normalisation layer). Using batch normalisation usually allows for a higher learning rate. The layer definition includes the number of inputs to normalise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) A dropout layer. This layer randomly sets outputs from the preceding layer to zero during training (a different set of outputs is zeroed for each training iteration). This helps prevent over-fitting of the model to the training data. Typically between 0.1 and 0.3 outputs are set to zero (`p=0.1` means 10% of outputs are set to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) An activation layer. In this case ReLU (rectified linear unit). ReLU activation is most common for the inner layers of a neural network. Negative input values are set to zero. Positive input values are left unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) A second linear fully connected layer which reduces the network down to 50 nodes. This is again followed by batch normalisation, dropout and ReLU activation layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) A final fully connected linear layer of two nodes (more nodes could be used for more classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Apply sigm0id activation to convert each output node to range 0-1 output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the net are two numbers (corresponding to scored for died/survived) between 0 and 1. These do not necessarily add up exactly to one. The one with the highest value is taken as the classification result.\n"
